# HofLebensberg_nutAF
## Holistic decision analysis model of the nut agroforestry system of Hof Lebensberg.

# System description:
We are developing a holistic DA model for a 7.53-ha nut alley cropping system at [Hof Lebensberg] (https://hoflebensberg.de/) (plot 1 of the German living lab under [ReForest project] (https://agroreforest.eu/).
It contains a vartiety of nut trees:
X rows of 420 Hazelnut (Corylus avellana) trees, 
X rows of 208 Walnuts (Juglans spp.) trees,
X rows of 183 Chestnut (Castanea sativa/Aesculus hippocastanum) trees, 
X rows of 68 Pecan (Carya illinoinensis) trees, 
X rows of 89 Cashewnuts (Anacardium occidentale) trees,
X rows of 73 Almonds (Prunus dulcis) trees, and 
X rows of 23 Hickory (Carya spp.)  planted syntropically with shrubs. Between the tree rows, wheat, dinkel and einkorn are currently grown. 

# Scenario:
The farmers plan changing the system from silvoarable to silvopastoral once the shade of the trees start affecting the arable crop yield. A scenario of changing the system based on Gompertz curve for tree growth is being thought of. This will model provide recommendation to farmer about their planned system change. 

# Institutional Support:
Since the farmers have not registered the land as AF, the subsidy or financial support parameter  will account for the type registered by the farmer.

# External shocks:
The farm experienced wildfire in 2023. Therefore, based on the continuous dry days during peak summer from climate change data can be added to the model (??)
