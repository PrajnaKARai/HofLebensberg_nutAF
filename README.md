# HofLebensberg_nutAF
## Holistic decision analysis model of the nut agroforestry system of Hof Lebensberg.

# System description:
This AF system contains X rows of XX hazelnut trees, X rows XX trees, planted syntropically with shrubs. Between the tree rows, wheat, dinkel and einkorn are currently grown. 

# Scenario:
The farmers plan changing the system from silvoarable to silvopastoral once the shade of the trees start affecting the arable crop yield. A scenario of changing the system based on Gompertz curve for tree growth is being thought of. This will model provide recommendation to farmer about their planned system change. 

# Institutional Support:
Since the farmers have not registered the land as AF, the subsidy parameter will account for the type registered by the farmer.

# External shocks:
The farm experienced wildfire in 2023. Therefore, based on the continuous dry days during peak summer from climate change data can be added to the model (??)
